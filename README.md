Here I will try to solve gymnasium problems using reinforcement learning algorithms.

If you are trying to install packages from requirements.txt in Ubuntu, run the below command first:
```console
$ sudo apt-get install python3-dev swig3.0
```

For Mujoco:
```console
$ sudo apt install libosmesa6-dev libgl1-mesa-glx libglfw3 patchelf
```
